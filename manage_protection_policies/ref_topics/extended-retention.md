# Extended retention
{: #extended_retention}


Snapshots selected for extended retention are retained for a longer time than defined in the protection schedule. You can retain the first snapshot of the backup run taken on the specified hours, every run, days, weeks, months, or years for a longer period of time.

The retention period can be set to a maximum value of 365000 days.

You can create one or more extended schedules.

For example, you could define a protection schedule that captures snapshots every hour and retains them on the {{site.data.keyword.baas_full_notm}} for 1 day. This protection schedule retains 24 sets of snapshots on a rotating basis, each hour a new set of snapshots are retained and the oldest set of snapshots is deleted.
If you want to retain a subset of these snapshots for a longer period of time, you could define an additional extended retention schedule to retain a single subset of snapshots daily for 90 days. This extended retention schedule retains 90 sets of snapshots on a rotating basis, each day a new set of snapshots are retained and the oldest set of snapshots is deleted.

If you specify multiple extended retention rules for the same set of snapshots with different retention periods, the snapshots are retained for the longest specified time period. For example if you define two extended retention rules that retain the same set of snapshots but one rule specifies a retention period of 90 days and another specifies a retention period of 180 days, the set of snapshots are retained for 180 days.

For backup, archive, replication, and CloudSpin; the extended retention schedule is as follows:

*   **Weekly**: The first successful run that started on a Sunday or later.
*   **Monthly**: The first successful run that started on the first day of the month or later.
*   **Yearly**: The first successful run that started on the first day of the year or later.

For backup schedule, {{site.data.keyword.baas_full_notm}} allows you to set the day for weekly backup and any day of the week for monthly backup.

If a backup fails, the extended retention is applied to the next scheduled snapshot taken by the {{site.data.keyword.baas_full_notm}}. However, if a manual backup was run in place of the failed backup after selecting "all objects" when selecting the VMs, extended retention is applied to the manual snapshot. For example, you've set the extended retention to be applied on the first snapshot on the first of every month. The scheduled backup on Feb 1st fails. After selecting all the objects (VMs), you run a manual backup successfully. The extended retention is applied to the snapshot of the manual backup.
