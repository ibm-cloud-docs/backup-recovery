# Recover microsoft sql server database as a new database in the original microsoft sql server instance
{: #recover_microsoft_sql_server_database_as_a_new_database_in_the_original_microsoft_sql_server_instance}

To recover the database as a new database in the original MS SQL server instance:

1. In the {{site.data.keyword.baas_full}} Console, select **Data Protection > Recoveries**.

2. Click **Recover** located at the top right of the page and then select **Databases** > **MS SQL**.

    The Restore SQL page appears.

3. Search for the databases you want to recover from by entering characters of the database name, Protection Group name, or by [specifying the wildcard character \*](/docs/backup-recovery?topic=backup-recovery-use_wildcard_*_in_search_for_recovery&interface=ui). A list of databases is displayed with details like {{site.data.keyword.baas_full_notm}}, Protection Group, Physical Server, and Create Date. The Create Date option indicates the date and timestamp when the database was created.

    Operations like rename may update the creation date at the SQL Server.

4. From the list of search results, select one or more databases you want to recover. You can select multiple MS SQL databases only if they are protected by the same protection group.

    The option to select multiple databases in a recovery task is an Early Access feature. Contact [IBM Cloud Support](https://cloud.ibm.com/unifiedsupport/supportcenter) for enabling this feature.

    By default, the latest recovery point is selected. To select a different recovery point, from the selected lists, mouse over the recovery point, and then click the edit icon.

    The Edit recovery point for <database\_name> page appears.

    By default, the option to select the recovery point is displayed in **Timeline** mode. You can also choose to view the option in **List** mode by clicking the **List** tab in the top-right corner of the page. The **Timeline** mode displays the full backups (recovery points) captured at the scheduled time and the CDP-based data available for point-in-time restore. The **List** tab displays only the full backups captured at a scheduled time.

    *  To select a recovery point from the Timeline mode:

        1. From the **Choose a date** drop-down, select a date.

            The recovery points available on the selected date are displayed in blue dots on the timeline bar and the point-in-time for restore is displayed in a solid green line on the timeline bar.

        2. To recover from a full backup, click the corresponding blue dot. For point-in-time restore, specify the exact point-in-time recovery by sliding the timeline bar.

        3. By default, the data is recovered from the local cluster. You can also select a recovery point archived to the cloud by clicking the cloud icon if available in the **Location** option.

        4. Click **Select Recovery Point** and then go to step 5.


    *   To select a recovery point from the List mode:

        1. Select the **List** tab from the top-right corner of the Edit recovery point for <database\_name> page.

            By default, the page displays the recovery points available for the last 30 days.

        2. You can also select a recovery point from a different date range by selecting the date range from the Date drop-down list. The page displays the available recovery points in the specified range.

        3. Select the recovery points to be recovered.

        4. By default, the data is recovered from the local cluster. You can also select a recovery point archived to the cloud by clicking the cloud icon if available in the **Location** option.

        5. Click **Select Recovery Point** and then go to step 5.


5. Click **Next: Recover Options**.

6. From the **Targets** option, select **Recover as a new Database** to recover the database as a new database.

7. Enable the **Restore to Original SQL Server Instance** option to restore the database in the original MS SQL Server instance.

8. In the **Data Files** field, specify the path to an existing directory. The newly created database files will reside in this path.

    If the database file names to be restored have a conflict with existing database files of the database to which files are restored, then {{site.data.keyword.baas_full_notm}} resolves the conflict by appending a number to the file names.

9. In the **Log Files** field, provide the full path location to which the log files can be restored.

10. (Optional) Click **Add File Path Rules** add custom rules for the data files.

    You can provide a full path or pattern for the original files and a location to restore to. When providing a location, use the standard path format. For example, use C:\\path for Windows instead of the extended path format \\\\?\\c:\\path.

    Accept the file patterns and examples:

    *   Wildcard character used for file matching such as \*
        *   _\*.ndf_ - All ndf files. Useful if you want every ndf file to go to the same folder
        *   _m:\\\*.ndf_ - Every ndf file on drive m:
        *   _c:\\\*1.ndf_ - Every ndf file on drive c: that contains 1.ndf
    *   Regex pattern


    *   _.\*\\.ndf_ - All files with the ndf extension
    *   _^.\*foo1.\*\\.ndf$_ - All files with the word foo1 and the extension ndf

    *   Full path to a source database file

    Database files that have non-default file extensions or that do not match a specified filename or pattern are restored to the data file restore location.

    Click **Add File Path Rule** to add multiple custom rules.

11. Specify the following **Recovery Options**:


    | Recovery Options | Description |
    | --- | --- |
    | **Rename** | Select one of the following options:<br><br>*   **Bulk Rename**: Select this option if you want to rename the restored databases in bulk. You can specify a string in the **Suffix** field. The restored databases will be renamed by adding this suffix string with the original database names.<br>*   **Rename Individual Objects**: Select this option if you want to individually rename the restored databases. You can specify the new name of the databases in the **New Name** field. |
    | **WITH RECOVERY** | Disable the option to perform a restore WITH NO RECOVERY (the database will be offline when restored). By default, this option is enabled and the database is restored with recovery (the database will be online when restored). |
    | VDI Restore Settings | Enable this option to specify the WITH clause that you want to use for the restore.<br><br>This option is available only for restoring the databases that are protected using [Backup Microsoft SQL Server (VDI-based)](/docs/backup-recovery?topic=backup-recovery-backup_microsoft_sql_server_vdi-based). |
    | Keep CDC | Enable this option to restore a protected database that has the change data capture (CDC) enabled. If the protected database is not CDC enabled and the user tries to restore it with Keep CDC then, the database will be restored without CDC.<br><br>This option is available only if the database is restored with recovery. |
    | Overwrite Alternate Database | Enable this option to recover the database by overwriting the existing database. |
    | Cluster Interface | By default, the **Auto Select** option is enabled and the recovery task automatically selects the correct VLAN. If you disable this option, then select a configured interface group from the **Interface Grou**p drop-down. |
    | Task Name | Change the default name of the recovery task. |
