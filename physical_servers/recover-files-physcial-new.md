    The {{site.data.keyword.baas_full_notm}} attempts to index all files and folders to a drive on both Windows and Linux systems. If the {{site.data.keyword.baas_full_notm}} is unable to find mount point information about files or directories, it indexes and displays these files and directories in the `lvol_N` directory, where `N` is a unique number such as `1`. ![Closed](../../../Skins/Default/Stylesheets/Images/transparent.gif)(#)

    On Windows systems, if the {{site.data.keyword.baas_full_notm}} finds the mount point information about files and directories, it indexes and displays these files and directories with a drive letter such as `C:`.

    Linux LVM indexing supports the following LVM types only: Linear, Striped, Mirrored, Mirrored + Striped, Thin. On Linux systems, how files and directories are indexed and displayed is dependent on the conditions specified in the following table.

    | Server Type | Volume Type |     |
    | --- | --- | --- |
    | Linux Virtual Machine | Simple Volume | The {{site.data.keyword.baas_full_notm}} detects mount points for entries in the `/etc/fstab` file with the following formats:<br><br>UUID=ccd1d599-e68e-4b88-ba9b-6f75b63f1bdc /mnt ext4 auto 0<br><br>UUID="ccd1d599-e68e-4b88-ba9b-6f75b63f1bdc" /mnt ext4 auto 0<br><br>If the {{site.data.keyword.baas_full_notm}} can detect a mount point, it indexes and displays files and directories in the volume with the mount point that was specified in the `/etc/fstab` file. For these example entries, files and directories are indexed with the `/mnt` mount path, such as `/mnt/example/test.txt`.<br><br>If the {{site.data.keyword.baas_full_notm}} cannot detect a mount point, the {{site.data.keyword.baas_full_notm}} indexes the files and directories into a `lvol_N` directory. For example, the `/mnt/example/test.txt` file is indexed as `/lvol_1/example/test.txt`. |
    | Linux Virtual Machine | LVM Volume | The {{site.data.keyword.baas_full_notm}} detects mount points for entries in the `/etc/fstab` file with the following formats:<br><br>UUID=ccd1d599-e68e-4b88-ba9b-6f75b63f1bdc /mnt ext4 auto 0<br><br>/dev/mapper/VG1-root /mnt ext4 defaults 1 1<br><br>/dev/VG1/root /mnt ext4 defaults 1 1  <br><br>If the {{site.data.keyword.baas_full_notm}} can detect a mount point, it indexes and displays files and directories in the volume with the mount point specified in the `/etc/fstab` file. For these example entries, files and directories are indexed with the `/mnt` mount path, such as `/mnt/example/test.txt`.<br><br>If the {{site.data.keyword.baas_full_notm}} cannot detect a mount point, the {{site.data.keyword.baas_full_notm}} indexes the files and directories into a `lvol_N` directory. For example, the `/mnt/example/test.txt` file is indexed as `/lvol_1/example/test.txt`. |
    | Linux Physical | LVM Volume | The Backup agent can only return mount data when the volume is mounted on the Linux physical Server. If the volume is mounted, the {{site.data.keyword.baas_full_notm}} indexes and displays files and directories in the volume with the mount point such as `/mnt/example/test.txt`.<br><br>If the volume is not mounted, the {{site.data.keyword.baas_full_notm}} indexes the files and directories into a `lvol_N` directory. For example, the `/mnt/example/test.txt` file is indexed as `/lvol_1/example/test.txt`. |

4. Once you select the files and folder to recover, select one of the following options:

    *   **Next Recover Option**: If you select this option, then continue with the step 5 to configure the file recovery options.

    *   **Download Files**: If you are recovering a single file, this option downloads the file to your browser’s download folder. For all other selections, this creates a recover task. When the task completes, from the Recoveries page, click the task name and then click **Download Files** to download the generated zip file.

        [![Closed](../../../Skins/Default/Stylesheets/Images/transparent.gif)Character replacement explanation for : and \\ in file and directory names in zip files](#)

        If the original file or directory name contains a ‘:’ , it is replaced with ‘\_COLON\_’ in the archive.
        Example:

        *   The original name is "a:b" then the archived name is "a\_COLON\_b"
        *   The original name is "a:b:c" then the archived name is "a\_COLON\_b\_COLON\_c"

        If the original file or directory name contains a ‘\\’, it is replaced with '\_BACK\_SLASH\_' in the archive.
        Example:

        *   The original name is “x\\y" then the archived name is "x\_BACK\_SLASH\_y"
        *   The original name is "x\\y\\z" then the archived name is "x\_BACK\_SLASH\_y\_BACK\_SLASH\_z"

5. From the **Recover To**, select **New Server** to recover the files or folders to a new server.

6. From the **Registered Source** drop-down menu, select a registered server to which you want to recover the files and folders. You can also register a new source by clicking **Register Source** from the **Source** drop-down menu.

7. From the **Target** drop-down menu, select a server to which the files and files are to be recovered.

8. Change the default location to which the files or folders are recovered. By default, the files and folders are recovered to the **/tmp/** directory.

9. Optional. Edit the default settings of the following **Recovery options**:

    *   **Overwrite Existing File/Folder**: By default, this option is disabled to create the files and folders in the specified location. Enable this option to overwrite the existing files and folders. Any duplicate files are skipped.

        Example for a Windows alternate location with **Overwrite Existing File/Folder** enabled and the target already exists:

        Files to be recovered: "C:\\foo\\1.txt", "C:\\foo\\test\\1.txt", "C:\\bar", "C:\\foo\\bar". Specified alternate location: "C:\\restore". At the end of the copy, the target folder looks like this:

        *   C:\\restore\\1.txt

        *   C:\\restore\\backup-recovery<taskid>\_0\\1.txt

        *   C:\\restore\\bar

        *   C:\\restore\\backup-recovery<taskid>\_1\\bar


        If **Overwrite Existing File/Folder** is enabled, recovering a file to source when the file is in Fuse may cause the open file to be overwritten. Whether overwriting occurs depends on the application using the file.

    *   **Preserve File/Folder Attributes**: By default, this option is enabled and the ACLs, permissions, and timestamps are preserved for all files and folders. If you disable this option, then ACLs and permissions are not preserved. If recovering both folders and files, then folders will receive the new timestamps, but files retain their original timestamps. If recovering only, files, then files will receive the new timestamps.

    *   **Continue on Error**: Enable this option if you want to continue the recovery even if one of the objects encounters an error. By default, this option is disabled and the recovery operation will fail if one of the objects encounters an error.

    *   **Cluster Interface**: By default, the **Auto Select** option is enabled and the recovery task automatically selects the correct VLAN. If you disable this option, then select a configured interface group from the Interface Group drop-down.

    *   **Task Name**: Change the default name of the recovery task.

    *   **Save Success Files**: Enable this option to download the success logs for a recovery run.

10. Click **Start Recovery**.


The recovery task is initiated. You can monitor the recovery task from the Recoveries page.

### Download list information for a recovery run
{: #download_list_information_for_a_recovery_run}

System-generated lists are used to verify success or errors during recovery. You can now download the list information as a CSV file for both successes and failed recovery job runs on the {{site.data.keyword.baas_full_notm}}.
