# Manage firewall ports
{: #manage_firewall_ports}

You must open certain ports in the firewall to allow the {{site.data.keyword.baas_full_notm}} to transmit and receive data. The cluster sends the following types of traffic over the network. You can isolate traffic on physical or logical networks to improve performance and security.

*   IPMI traffic for admins to access nodes, typically for pre-boot BIOS access and post-boot console access.
*   Management traffic:

    *   from Nodes to external services such as Active Directory, DNS, NTP and SNMP
    *   for admins to access the {{site.data.keyword.baas_full_notm}}
*   Backup and restore traffic for moving data between protected sources and the cluster.
*   Replication traffic for replicating data from one cluster to another cluster.
*   Data access (NAS) traffic for accessing data on the cluster by using protocols such as NFS, SMB or S3.
*   Archive and tiering traffic for moving data to external targets such as a cloud or tape system.
*   Support Channel traffic between nodes and the IBM Cloud Support servers.
*   Internal traffic between nodes on a cluster.

Using the {{site.data.keyword.baas_full_notm}} UI or CLI, you can configure application-based firewall rules and manage incoming traffic on a {{site.data.keyword.baas_full_notm}}. For more details, see [Manage Application-Based Firewall Rules](ManageRules.htm#top).

### Identify source ip of outgoing traffic
{: #identify_source_ip_of_outgoing_traffic}

The source IP of outgoing traffic depends on the matching static routeâ€™s outgoing interface. If there is no static route, the source IP depends on the default route's outgoing interface. Use the route list command to view the list of routes configured on an interface in a {{site.data.keyword.baas_full_notm}} and the IP address of the destination network.

In the following example, the route list command output shows the VLAN interface (intf\_group1.100) of a cluster configured with the default route.

iris\_cli route list

DEST NETWORK                  : 0.0.0.0/0

NEXT HOP                      : 10.1.100.1

INTERFACE GROUP NAME          : intf\_group1.100

For more details, see [Add a Static Route](../CLI/StaticRoute.htm).

## Cluster management
{: #cluster_management}

### Cluster upgrade
{: #cluster_upgrade}

If the {{site.data.keyword.baas_full_notm}} uses an interface with the node IP address to reach the external server or client, configure the firewall settings to allow the node IP addresses. If the {{site.data.keyword.baas_full_notm}} uses an interface with only virtual IP addresses, configure the firewall settings to allow the virtual IP addresses. To identify whether the source IP is Static IP or Virtual IP for outgoing traffic, see [Identify Source IP of Outgoing Traffic](#Identify).

## Cohesity cli commands used to manage firewall ports
{: #cohesity_cli_commands_used_to_manage_firewall_ports}

For on-premises clusters, you can use the following {{site.data.keyword.baas_full_notm}} CLI commands to manage the cluster firewall configuration. For more information, see [Using the Cohesity CLI](https://docs.cohesity.com/7_2/Web/PDFs/72_PlatformCLI.pdf){: external} and [List of Cohesity CLI Commands](../CLI_Reference/Objects.htm).

The firewall commands use the following terminology: Active {{site.data.keyword.baas_full_notm}} rules are called an _attachment_. An attachment includes a _profile_ and multiple _ipsets_. A profile is a group of TCP or UDP ports. An ipset is subnet with the format of <IP/prefix>. An attachment can be on one or more specific network interfaces or it can apply to all interfaces when no interface is specified.


| CLIÂ Command | Description |
| --- | --- |
| firewall-profile activate | Activates a profile on a list of interfaces with a list of ipsets. |
| firewall-profile add | Adds a collection of service ports with the protocol of each port for the firewall. |
| firewall-profile deactivate | Deactivates a list of active firewall profiles. |
| firewall-profile delete | Removes a list of firewall profiles. |
| firewall-profile list | Lists the groups of firewall profiles. |
| firewall-profile list-active | Lists all the active firewall profiles. Each attachment activates a profile on specific network interfaces and ipsets. |
| firewall-ipset list | Lists the IP sets for a firewall. |
| firewall-profile activate revert-to-default | Reverts all the firewall rules to the default settings. |
{: caption="" caption-side="bottom"}

To list the parameters for each command, type `help` after the `firewall-profile <option>` or `firewall-ipset <option>` for example:

admin@node-1> firewall-profile activate help
